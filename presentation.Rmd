# About R

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. (Ref: [`r-project.org`](https://www.r-project.org/about.html))

- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand

- R is Free

- R can be extended (easily) via *packages*.

- R is an interpreted language

# About RStudio


- RStudio is a **free and open-source IDE** for R, released by the company **RStudio, Inc.** 

- RStudio and its team regularly contribute to R community by releasing new packages, such as:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `shiny`
  - `knitr`

# R Ecosystem

Like `Python`, `R`'s strength lies in its Ecosystem. **Why R?** - R Packages


### Growth

# Basics of R Programming

# Hello, World!


The traditional first step - **Hello, World!**:

--

```{r eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
print("Hello, World!") #<<
 
```

<br/>

###.center[That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind]

# Arithmetic Operations

```{r}
2 + 3
```

```{r}
50000 * 42222
```

```{r}
2304 / 233
```

```{r}
(33 + 44 ) * 232 / 12
```

---

# Assignment Operators

### .center[`<-` **Arrow (Less-than < and Minus - )**]

### .center[`=` **(Equal Sign)**]

```{r}
(x <- 2 + 3)
```


```{r}
(y = x ** 4) #<<
```

```{r}
5 * 9 -> a
a
```

# Data wrangling and Visualization using Tidyverse

---

# Tidyverse


- An opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
- All packages share an underlying design *philosophy, grammar, and data structures*. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### tidyverse packages

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_packages()
```

---

# Loading the Library

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```


---

# Input Data

Reading the dataset

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#kaggle <- read_csv("data/kaggle_survey_2018.csv")

kaggle <- read_csv("data/kaggle_survey_2018.csv", skip = 1)
```

---

# Basic Stats

### Dimension (Rows Column)

```{r}

dim(kaggle)
```

```{r}
glimpse(kaggle)
```

# Dataset Overview 
## Demo on RStudio

# Data Questions (Business Problem)

- What's the percentage of Male and Female respondents?

- What are the top 10 countries?

---

# dyplr verbs

- `mutate()` - adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `select()` - picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` - picks cases based on their values.
- `summarise()` - reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()` - changes the ordering of the rows.

---

# Introducing %>% Pipe Operator

- The pipe, `%>%`, comes from the magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache

- **Output of LHS** is given as the **input (first argument) of RHS**

### Example

```{r}

kaggle %>% dim()

```

Although doesn't make much sense to use `%>%` in this context, Hope it explains the function.

---

# Percentage of Male and Female

* Column name - `What is your gender? - Selected Choice`

### Pseudo-code

- `group_by` the `kaggle` dataframe on column `What is your gender? - Selected Choice`
- `count` the values 
-  calculate `percentage` value from the `count`s

---

# % of Male and Female - Group By & Count

```{r}
kaggle %>% 
  group_by(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`) %>% 
  count() 
```

---

# % of Male and Female - Group By & Count - Sorted 

```{r}
kaggle %>% 
  group_by(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


---

# % of Male and Female - Percentage


```{r}
kaggle %>% 
  group_by(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(perc = round(n / sum(n),2))
```

---

# % of Male and Female - Nice_Looking_Table


```{r}
kaggle %>% 
  group_by(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(perc = round(n / sum(n),2)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

# But, Wait!!!
## Go Back and See 
### If you have only `Male` and `Female`?


---

class: inverse,center,middle

# Time for some cleaning
## In the form of `filter()`ing

---

# % of Male and Female - Filtered_Nice


```{r}
kaggle %>% 
  filter(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice` %in% c("Male","Female")) %>% 
  group_by(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(perc = round(n / sum(n),2)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
 

---

class: inverse,center,middle

# Awkward!!!
## The column name isn't it?

---

# % of Male and Female - All_Nice_Table

```{r}
library(scales) #for Percentage Formatting

kaggle %>% 
  filter(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice` %in% c("Male","Female")) %>% 
  group_by(`What is your gender? - Selected Choice`) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(perc = round(n / sum(n),2)) %>% 
  mutate(perc = scales::percent(perc)) %>% 
  rename(Gender = `What is your gender? - Selected Choice`,
         Count = n,
         Percentage = perc) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
