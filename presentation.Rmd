# Basics of R Programming

# Hello, World!


The traditional first step - **Hello, World!**:

--

```{r eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
print("Hello, World!") #<<
 
```

# Arithmetic Operations

```{r}
2 + 3
```

```{r}
50000 * 42222
```

```{r}
2304 / 233
```

```{r}
(33 + 44 ) * 232 / 12
```

---

# Assignment Operators

### .center[`<-` **Arrow (Less-than < and Minus - )**]

### .center[`=` **(Equal Sign)**]

```{r}
(x <- 2 + 3)
```


```{r}
(y = x ** 4) #<<
```

```{r}
5 * 9 -> a
a
```

# Data wrangling and Visualization using Tidyverse

---

# Tidyverse


- An opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
- All packages share an underlying design *philosophy, grammar, and data structures*. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### tidyverse packages

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_packages()
```

---

# Loading the Library

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```


---

# Input Data

Reading the dataset

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#kaggle <- read_csv("data/kaggle_survey_2018.csv")

kaggle <- read_csv("data/kaggle_survey_2018.csv", skip = 1)
```

---

# Basic Stats

### Dimension (Rows Column)

```{r}

dim(kaggle)
```

```{r}
glimpse(kaggle)
```

## Demo on RStudio

---

# Data Questions (Business Problem)

- What's the percentage of Male and Female respondents?

- What are the top 10 countries?

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```
